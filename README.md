### Compiling JSON

1. Clone repo
2. cd into repo directory
3. run 'ruby compile.rb'

### Styles

- Sass files are in app/sass
- Compiled css is in app/css
- It is highly recommended that you make edits in the Sass file and compile. Editing the css directly may result in edits being overriden by the Sass compile.
- See installing dev tools below

### Installing Dev Tools (optional)

2. Run 'bundle install'
3. Run 'compass watch' (compiles Sass)
