  <h3>Availability</h3>
</div>
<p>
At this time, we are slowly rolling out access to this Beta version of the API to a small set of customers.  As this API is still under active development, usage of this API comes with caveats around rapid changes.  Please contact support or your account manager if you're interested in participating in the API beta program.

  <h3>Requesting an Access Token</h3>
</div>
<p>
Please contact support or your account manager to request access to this beta API.  If you want to integrate more than one service, it's preferable that you get two different API tokens for each of those services.  For example, if you want to integrate both a Marketing Automation service and a Support ticket service, you should use one token for each.

<div class="page-header">
  <h3>Permissioning</h3>
</div>
<p>
The RelateIQ API has the concept of limited permissioning of API access.  For example, an API token can have access to request contacts but not edit them.  When you request access for the API, please include in your request what actions you would like to authorize for that token.
