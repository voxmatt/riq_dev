<h1 class="intro-header">RelateIQ Beta v0.1 API</h1>

<i><p>
  <strong>Warning</strong>: This is an beta version of the RelateIQ API and while we will try to retain backwards compatability, there may still be some breaking changes.
</p></i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
The RelateIQ API is based on RESTful principles.  We strive to make the API standard across our objects, requests, responses, and errors.  We use HTTP authentication standards and HTTP methods to help simplify and better communicate what each method is doing.
