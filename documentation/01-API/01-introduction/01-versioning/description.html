  <h3>RelateIQ Alpha API</h3>
</div>
<p>
If you're using the older alpha API, please know that it will be deprecated.  We plan on leaving it available as people transition and we build up the functionality of the beta API but build all new integrations based on this Beta version of the RelateIQ API.
